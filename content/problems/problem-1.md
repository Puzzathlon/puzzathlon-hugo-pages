## Problem statement:
Given an arbitrary map consisting of a number of connected regions, find the shortest sequence of folds which ensures that every region overlaps every other region.

#### Definitions:

* **map** - 
* **region** - a continuous set of 2D points
* **fold** - a reflection operation that maps all points on one side of a given line to the other side. The operation can be formally described as: ----
* **overlap** - two regions overlap iff
